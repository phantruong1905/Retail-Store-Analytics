Retail Store Analytics Project
Project Overview
This project explores customer behavior, product interactions, and the effectiveness of marketing strategies in a retail store. By analyzing transaction data, product details, and customer interaction logs, the project provides actionable insights into sales patterns and helps optimize store layout and promotional efforts.

Techniques and Methods
Data Preprocessing: Utilized techniques such as data cleaning, encoding categorical variables, imputing missing values (using KNN imputer), and feature engineering (e.g., calculating product age and interaction duration).

Customer Segmentation: Grouped customers by age, behavior, and purchase patterns, allowing for targeted marketing strategies and shelf layout optimization.

Statistical Analysis: Performed summary statistics on customer interactions, identifying trends such as which items were most frequently viewed, handled, or returned.

Classification Models: Employed machine learning models (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Neural Networks) to predict the likelihood of customer purchases based on factors such as product discount, marketing efforts, and item characteristics.

Sales and Marketing Impact Analysis: Assessed the effectiveness of discounts and marketing campaigns on sales by comparing interaction times and purchase rates for advertised vs. non-advertised products.

Shelf Layout Optimization: Used item interaction data (e.g., low-interaction high-potential products) to suggest possible rearrangements of items on shelves, considering factors such as eye-level placement, weight, and sales potential.

Sequential Behavior Analysis: Tracked customer movement between different shelves, identifying common shopping patterns and suggesting optimized product placement to improve customer flow.
